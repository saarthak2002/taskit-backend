# task.it Backend

This is a REST API for the [task.it](https://github.com/saarthak2002/taskit-app) application written in Python using the Flask framework. A PostgreSQL database is used for persisting user data, and Firebase is used for authentication. The SQLAlchemy ORM is used for handling interactions with the database. The REST API and Postgres Database instance are hosted on Heroku. Postman was used for testing the REST API.

## Database Models
The following models are defined in the ORM:

### UserInfo
Fields: id (primary key), userUID (from Firebase), username, firstname, lastname

### Project
Fields: id (primary key), date_added, userUID (from Firebase), title, description, tasks (Task[]), task_categories (TaskCategory[])

### Task
Fields: id (primary key), date_added, title, description, project_id (Foreign key to id column of Projects table), status, task_category_name, task_category_color, created_by (UID from Firebase), completed_at_time, completed_by (UID from Firebase)

### TaskCategory
Fields: id (primary key), name, color, project_id (Foreign key to id column of Projects table)

### Collaborator
Fields: id (primary key), project_id (Foreign key to id column of Projects table), userUID (from Firebase)

## Frontend
This REST web service serves data to a frontend web application made with React. See the frontend source code [here](https://github.com/saarthak2002/taskit-app) or visit the [deployed version](https://taskit-frontend-a7880b47804a.herokuapp.com/).

The essential features of the platform can be accessed on the go using the [task.it mobile app](https://github.com/saarthak2002/taskit-mobile) built with Flutter.
